## 16. Community quirk index

Facts-only index of firmware/model-specific traps documented in the community issue tracker (bambuddy, AGPL — facts and links only, never code). Two-way linked: each row points at the chapter that owns the topic; those chapters link back here.

| Issue | Firmware / model | Trap (one sentence) | Research page | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
